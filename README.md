📈 Natural Gas Price Analysis

JPMorgan Chase & Co. – Analytics

🔍 Project Overview

This project is part of the JPMorgan Chase  Analytics and the objective of this task is to analyze, model, and interpret Natural Gas price movements using historical data and quantitative techniques—replicating the type of real-world analytical work performed by Quantitative Researchers at JPMorgan.

The project focuses on data-driven reasoning, time-series behavior, and market-oriented insights, emphasizing clarity, accuracy, and practical financial interpretation rather than black-box modeling.

🎯 Business Context

Natural Gas is a highly volatile commodity influenced by multiple real-world factors such as:

Seasonal demand (winter heating & summer cooling)

Storage levels and inventory cycles

Supply disruptions

Long-term market expectations


At JPMorgan, Quantitative Research teams analyze such instruments to:

Price financial contracts

Forecast future movements

Support trading and risk decisions


This task simulates how a Quantitative Research Analyst would explore historical price data, identify patterns, and justify assumptions using quantitative logic.
